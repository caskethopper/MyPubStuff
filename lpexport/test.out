People - Index.html not working
1
Chad Campbell
Break/Fix
<p>The People.cpcc.edu web redirect was updated for the username change pilot.</p>
<p>Previously, incoming requests could be accepted in the format http://people.cpcc.edu/~username or http://first.last.people.cpcc.edu. The modification was made to accept requests coming into the ~username format and pass it back through the Apache redirect engine with the first.last.people.cpcc.edu format.</p>
<p>In the course of making this change, index.html was broken so that it no longer automatically loads when placed in the root of the folder.</p>
Matt Rubright said: Re-assigned back to Chad for implementation. 
Matt Rubright said: I have a tested a functional configuration which fixes the index.html issue. It also corrects a problem I noted where the parent directory link wasn't working. The heart of the issue was that this rewrite rule ...

RewriteRule ^(.*)\.people\.cpcc\.edu(.*) /route/${user-map:$1}/www$2 [PT]

... was being called repeatedly. I've changed the flag so that it only gets called once *and* it skips the next two rules when it applies at all. Also, I added a default to the reverse mapping lookup so that you end up with a real URL, even when the lookup fails (covering situations where a person might leave and there are old links around.) 

Since I don't feel it's my place to make changes to production systems like this without advance warning, I thought I would leave that part to you. The new configuration is in /home/cagwmatt/newpeopleconfig.txt. You just need to replace /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/people.cpcc.edu with it and reload apache to make it work. 
Chad Campbell said: Matt, you are correct in your assessment of how it should process incoming requests. 
Matt Rubright said: Built test environment and have it working with the old configuration. 
Matt Rubright said: I'm moving forward with building a test environment of my own to try different configurations. Please clarify if anything I've written in the last update is incorrect. 
Matt Rubright said: Looking more closely into this, I'm a little confused about what exactly you're trying to do and at what state the SNAPe account conversion is. Are all users now moved over to the new account names? I'm mostly just curious about that. 

Would you please step through some details of what you want the redirects and rewrites to do. I see some steps which appear a bit fragile and maybe more complex than they need to be. Let me take a stab at what I *think* you're trying to do:

1) If a URL comes in with http://people.cpcc.edu/~OLDUSERNAME we want it to rewrite to http://first.last.people.cpcc.edu, rendering any index.html which it finds in U:\NEWUSERNAME\www.
2) If a URL comes in with http://people.cpcc.edu/~NEWUSERNAME we want it to rewrite to http://first.last.people.cpcc.edu, rendering any index.html which it finds in U:\NEWUSERNAME\www.
3) If a URL comes in with http://first.last.people.cpcc.edu, we want it to render any index.html which it finds in U:\NEWUSERNAME\www 
Matt Rubright said: Gathering data on the configuration and doing some analysis. Also, the server was out of disk space again, so I performed the same steps as last time. Any need for the log files in question are available in the home directory of 'logfiles' on sysmon-central. 
Matt Rubright said: Started looking into this but found the server out of disk space. The culprit looks to be the 'test.people.rewrite.log' files. I moved everything older than .20. out to a tarfile on sysmon-central in /home/logfiles. Don't know if you actually need them or not. 

Will pick back up on the original problem in the next few days.

Jordyn Newton said: I'm going to mark this one as complete. Even though i had problems getting the engines updated on a few servers, we're atleast protected by a few others on each server and i've been seeing things stopped at the hub transport servers so i feel we're in a better position. With the exchange upgrade coming in the next few months, i don't feel it's worth the time to dig in any deeper, and my efforts would be better served at getting the upgrade started. 
Jordyn Newton said: i've installed the forefront client on xca2-central and set up notifications to justin and spam mailbox for all hub transport and mailbox servers. I was still unable to update the scan engines on clustered resources as well as xca2-central. 
Jordyn Newton said: Some of the engines wouldn't receive updates, so i renamed the folder for the failing engine at \Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Forefront Security\Exchange Server\Data\Engines\x86\ which worked on the hub transport servers, as well as x7s1, but the clustered mailbox stores it doesn't seem to work on, even after navigating to the correct directory on P:\ForefrontCluster\Engines\x86, i rename, a new one is created, yet the old date for last date of update exists from 2011. 
Jordyn Newton said: I've found that there's a few retired engines still being used to scan. I've went through and made sure we're using the ones that are still receiving updates, and disabled the retired ones. I set up notifications for xht1 and xht2, but the mailbox servers will require a bit more time for tweaking out false positives and limiting the amount of notifications that are being sent. We're getting notifications for voicemails and regular office documents.

Also, xca2-central didn't have forefront for exchange installed with it being used as a hub transport server. I didn't see the software on msmgt1-central, nor the other exchange servers where it was already installed, nor the usual share locations of pubapps and shared applications. I also checked licensing folder for a serial number that i could use with the trial version that's freely available on MS website. I think i'll need you to hook me up with the serial from wherever it may be.

Sent from my Verizon Wireless 4G LTE DROID 
Matt Rubright said: @Patrick :

Okay, that makes sense. As an aside, how do you want to describe these links? The other intercampus links are called 'TWTC' and 'BSME'. 
Patrick Dugan said: @Matt:

Per my email...

"That's on purpose.  We're temporarily testing our WiFi bridge link to see how performant it is.  So we wanted it to be the only link for a while.

We bought some properties close to the central campus recently and cabinet is telling us they want to inexpensively bring them up.  Before i put all my eggs in the wifi bridge basket i wanted a proof of concept.

 

I believe Tam has the OSPF interface off on the core side to make this happen." 
Matt Rubright said: All these devices have been added to Nagios. I have pre-acknowledged the BSME check on ec-290-rr2 since it looks to be routing through rr1 at the moment, rather than over a MetroE link. I don't know if this is supposed to be by design, but I suspect it isn't?

Before I can add the devices to RADIUS, I'll need to have my account's key installed on rad1-central. Please let me know when that's done. 
Patrick Dugan said: We need the following devices added to nagios for checks. The routing devices need the routing table check added aswell. The "EC" devices need to be added into radius also:

Matt Rubright said: The script has been written and tied into Nagios. I took some liberties in interpreting what you want and in setting defaults. The check will be performed approximately every 15 minutes. If the result is under 80% full, it will indicate things are okay. If the result is between 80% an 97% full, it will set a warning state in the monitoring interface, but it will not email anyone. If the result is 98% full or above, the interface will show a critical state and it will email the groups defined for all the other services for each router.

Please let me know if you'd like any of these defaults changed. Otherwise, this task is complete.

Have a look at the Graph tree at the bottom under the 'Major Services' heading. There's a new grouping called 'Server Load Balancing' which will have graphs from each load balancer for each service. Of course, only one graph will have data at a time, but collecting from both will make it possible to continue gathering data even if a failover occurs. I'll get the other services added hopefully by the end of this week.

&gt; The SR cannot be closed until the FS Task used to ship the replacement
&gt; SAS HD is closed.
&gt;
&gt; The FS Task cannot be closed until our logistics partner receives the
&gt; faulty SAS HD via shipment from you (unless this particular disk model
&gt; is considered a consumable).
&gt;
&gt; So there is nothing I can do to bring this SR to a close until that
&gt; return shipment is processed.  The SR will auto-close once the FS Task
&gt; is closed by our logistics partner.

&gt;&gt; Just following up on this as I think we can probably bring this SR to a

&gt;&gt; learned that there were two boot environments configured via LiveUpdate,
&gt;&gt; that the previous admin had not collapsed back into one. With the disk
&gt;&gt; failure that was the cause of the system not booting, as the boot-device
&gt;&gt; was set to the failed disk.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The return package with the failed drive was dropped off with Fedex last

&gt;&gt;&gt; The disk at the following location appears to be 'disk1':
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;       /pci@0,600000/pci@0/pci@8/pci@0/scsi@1/disk@1,0:a
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The disk in slot HDD#1 is 'disk1' per OBP's alias definition.  This
&gt;&gt;&gt; would explain why the domain was having problems booting from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; default boot device (because 'disk1' is apparently the default boot
&gt;&gt;&gt; device).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; You could be able to change the default boot device from the OBP shell
&gt;&gt;&gt; via the following command:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;       ok&gt;  setenv boot-device disk
&gt;&gt;&gt;       ok&gt;  reset-all
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please let me know if that works without issues for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The default boot not working as you mentioned in your first comment
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; below concerns me somewhat as well, mainly due to my lack of knowledge
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regarding the filesystem configuration.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't dig through the snapshot that was emailed but looking at just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the boot-device environment variable it is set to:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; {0} ok printenv boot-device
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boot-device = /pci@0,600000/pci@0/pci@8/pci@0/scsi@1/disk@1,0:a disk:a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where as the 'disk' alias (as passed by `boot disk` I'm guessing) is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; {0} ok devalias
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cdrom     /pci@0,600000/pci@0/pci@8/pci@0/scsi@1/disk@3,0:f
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; net       /pci@0,600000/pci@0/pci@8/pci@0/network@2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disk      /pci@0,600000/pci@0/pci@8/pci@0/scsi@1/disk@0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; name                     aliases
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could that be the reason `boot disk` worked where as the default boot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; method did not? It looks like it is trying to boot from the second disk,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which would make sense why the normal boot just hangs as the bootloader
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is waiting for the scsi controller to init the drive which never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happens.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I tried executing the following which resulted in a boot (after a short
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; delay), ending up at the same root password for system maintenance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt, as would be expected given the system state:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; {0} ok boot /pci@0,600000/pci@0/pci@8/pci@0/scsi@1/disk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Boot device: /pci@0,600000/pci@0/pci@8/pci@0/scsi@1/disk  File and args:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would it be prudent to change the 'boot-device' environment variable and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write it to nvram, and if so what should it be changed to? I'm guessing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; either the boot parameter I passed above, or updating the 'disk'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; devalias to that and setting 'boot-device=disk'. I'm still waiting on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; access to the secure room where that server is housed to remove the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; failed drive. My boss has that key and he is out of the office the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half of the day, sorry about that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I find it interesting that just 'boot' was not working for you previous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (per the console logs that the XSCF snapshot utility had copied) but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'boot disk' did work.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Based on the SCSI errors following the boot, it appears that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disk in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slot HDD#1 (c0t1d0 I assume) is dead.  That SAS HD will need to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; replaced, and based on the 'probe-scsi-all' output, it is a 146 GB
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; model.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You could safely power down the domain "oc196-m4000" if you wished
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so.  While it is powered down, you could also safely eject the SAS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HD in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slot HDD#1 and keep it disconnected from the disk backplane while you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wait for a replacement.  If you decide to do this, then I would also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like for you to read the disk label on that faulty disk in slot HDD#1
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and provide me with the Sun PN (i.e., part number, which should be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; string of digits in the format of xxx-xxxx-xx) in a reply to this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; email.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The internal SAS HDs within M3000, M4000, and M5000 servers are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; categorized as CRUs (Customer Replaceable Units) per the Oracle System
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Handbook; therefore, our policy is to just ship you the replacement SAS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HD to your data center or other site with the expectation that your own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on-site personnel would perform the physical disk replacement.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please let me know if the following address is a valid shipping address
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for the replacement SAS HD:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have left the server at that prompt for the time being for fear of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; corrupting anything further as I'm unfamiliar with Solaris. If like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Linux (or vice versa I suppose) then the volumes are read-only but let
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me know if it is safe to issue a powerdown there and I will follow up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after changing the key position.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Chris Morton &lt;christopher.morton@oracle.com&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To: Ryan Moore &lt;Ryan.Moore@cpcc.edu&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: 07/29/2013 06:38 PM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After reviewing the XSCF snapshot, we are not seeing any blatant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hardware component failures within this M4000 server.  There are no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; components currently listed in either Degraded or Faulted status
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; according to the XSCF within this M4000 server.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, the internal SAS HDs are not subject to that fault
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; management
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tagging to where they could be labeled as Degraded or Faulted.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, we must use other means to determine if one of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; internal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SAS HDs is faulty (where I assume your root filesystem is currently
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stored).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please turn the physical keyswitch on the front of the current Locked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; position to the Service position.  That will prevent the M4000 domain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from attempting to auto-boot into Solaris.  Once that has been done,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; please issue the following commands:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         XSCF&gt;  poweroff -d 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         XSCF&gt;  poweron -d 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         XSCF&gt;  console -d 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That should force the domain to reset and start the console
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; connection
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to Domain ID 0 (DID#0).  Eventually, the POST tests should complete
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (hopefully without errors) and then present you with the OBP ok&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       At that prompt, please issue the following diagnostic command:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         ok&gt;  probe-scsi-all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once that command finishes returning output and returns a new ok&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt, please copy and past the output from that above OBP
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; command and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paste it into a reply to this email.  We would also like for you to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempt to boot off either of the 2 root mirrored disks via the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; following OBP commands (providing us the output regardless of either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; command's success or failure):
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         ok&gt;  boot disk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         ok&gt;  boot disk1
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead of copying / pasting test from your console session above,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could simply run the XSCF snapshot utility once again after all of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; above steps have been completed (regardless of their success or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; failure)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as it will copy the console logs via the snapshot.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for choosing Oracle.

Subject: Issue Tracking 

Let’s try to use this as an opportunity to test liquidplanner for issue tracking.

I created a task under Break/Fix -> Issue Tracking named Service Outage: OC196-M4000. The email address for the task is copied, but you can hit it at 10071827-819f8dcd0d3ca74c@in.liquidplanner.com (mailto:10071827-819f8dcd0d3ca74c@in.liquidplanner.com)

I tested, and it looks like it will add the emails we send into the comments for the task. As you gather information or the status changes (ie. Oracle is contacted, eta’s are determined) send an email to this address.
